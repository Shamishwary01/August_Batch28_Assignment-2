            <h1>The Wind And The Sun</h1>
          
            <p>The wind and the sun once had a competition about who is stronger. Each of them claimed to be strong, but even after many hours, they could not decide.

                Then, the sun came up with an idea. A traveler was walking down the road with a shawl wrapped around his shoulders. The sun proposed that the victor would be whoever could persuade the traveler to remove the shawl. The wind agreed.
                
                The wind started blowing. Initially, it blew gently, just a breeze. But soon, it picked up, rustling violently through the leaves. However, though the traveler’s shawl flapped, he gripped it more tightly to keep warm. Even with its best efforts, the wind could not blow off the shawl.
                
                When the sun’s turn came, the heat started gradually. First, it was pleasantly warm. Later, the sun kept getting hotter until it became quite hot. The man, unable to bear the heat, finally removed the shawl.
                
                Hence, the sun won the competition and was declared stronger than the wind.</p>

            <h1>The Tortoise And The Hare</h1>
            
            <p>Once, a proud hare believed no one could match his speed. He often teased the slow tortoise, challenging him to a race. The tortoise, initially ignoring the taunts, eventually accepted the challenge.

                On the race day, with the forest animals watching, the hare mocked the tortoise, sure of an easy win. As the race started, the hare raced ahead, confident of victory. However, seeing the tortoise steadily walking, the hare decided to take a break, eat cabbages, and even nap.
                
                Waking up later, the hare panicked, realizing the tortoise was near the finish line. Surprisingly, the tortoise won, teaching the hare a lesson about humility and not underestimating others.</p>
